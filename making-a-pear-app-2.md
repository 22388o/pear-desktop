# Making your first Pear app

This tutorial build on top of [this tutorial](/making-a-pear-app-1.md) and will teach you how to send persistent state between peers, by sharing a peer's nickname.

It is important to understand that the complexity increases from the first version of the chat app. This is because there was no shared state between them in the first example. In peer-to-peer, if peer A writes some data, then peer C may receive this data from peer B, but still needs to be able to verify that it was written by A and not tampered with.

## Understand how hypercore data is shared and accessed

Before going into the code, we need to explain how data is shared in the network of peers, but can't be accessed by everyone. This means that the whole network helps to share data, even though they may not even be able to have access to it. A lot of this happens under the hood, but it's important to understand.

**Sequence diagram about how blocks of data can be shared without read access**

```
Peer A                Peer B                     Peer C
  |
Writes block a1b2c3
  |
  |  ====Send key====>  |
  |                     |
  |  =============Send block a1b1c3=============>  |
  |                     |                          |
  |                     | <===Send block a1b1c3==  |
```

In this scenario Peer A shares its (read access) key with Peer B. Some data from Peer A's hypecore is send to Peer C. Because Peer C does not have access to Peer A's key, they cannot read it. Later on, Peer B gets the block of data from Peer C, and can now read it.

The most important thing to understand is how data and read access to data is not the same ting.


## Step 1. Install modules.

For this tutorial you will need to add `corestore`, `hyperbee`, and `protomux-rpc`.

```
$ npm i corestore hyperbee protomux-rpc
```

- [protomux-rpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protomux-rpc). Allows us to use rpc (remote procedure calls) on top of hyperswarm.
- [corestore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/corestore). A [hypercore](https://github.com/holepunchto/hypercore) is an append-only log that can be written by one, but shared between peers. Corestore is a way to handle several hypercores. In this example we use this to store our own nickname. Every time we change our nickname, it will be a new log entry.
- [hyperbee](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperbee). Use a [hypercore](https://github.com/holepunchto/hypercore) as a map, which you use to store the (read access) `key` for know peers' hypercore.

## Step 2. Initialize state

First you'll need to store all the state that our app needs to know. A `Corestore` is really just a factory of `hypercore`. A `hypercore` is an append-only log, where it's guaranteed that only a single peer can write to it, but all other peers can share it between each other. Each new entry in `hypercore` is called a block.

The store is always written to disk, and if you use `config.storage` it's possible to pass a path to our app with `-s /tmp/foo`. This will become important when you need to run your app.

``` js
const store = new Corestore(config.storage)
```

You'll need to store the state of this peer's user somewhere. To do that `userCore` is where we'll append a block (new state). Every time the nickname of the user changes, the change is appended as a new block. Blocks are shared between peers and they can verify that it was written by you.

``` js
const userCore = store.get({
  name: 'local',
  valueEncoding: 'json'
})
```

Initially a peer cannot read other peers' hypercores. Even if you have the blocks, you cannot read them. This is a way to ensure that data can be shared between peers, even though not all of them can read the data. If peer B needs to read data from peer A, they will need to receive their `hypercore.key` somehow.

To store this locally you'll use another `hypercore`, but because this is a map, you can use `hyperbee` for it. `Hyperbee` is a map abstraction on top of a `hypercore` (it's a B-tree, but that's not relevant for this).

``` js
const peerCoreKeys = new Hyperbee(store.get({ // swarm.connection.remotePublicKey => coreKey
  name: 'peerCoreKeys'
}), {
  keyEncoding: 'binary',
  valueEncoding: 'binary'
})
```

### Step 3. Bootstrapping data

Often you will need to handle if there needs to be some first version of the state. In this case, it's just the nickname, so just generate a random name, and store it.

``` js
// Bootstrap own nickname
const isFirstRun = userCore.length === 0
if (isFirstRun) {
  await userCore.append({
    nickname: `User ${Math.floor(1000 * Math.random())}`
  })
}
```

## Step 4. Enable replication of data

In the previous version of the chat app, all messages were just streams. Now you need to replicate the shared data, share access to that data, and send messages - which you'll still do over the stream you get from `hyperswarm`.

First enable replication with `store.replicate(connection)`. This tells the store to allow the peer (`connection`) to replicate all the blocks of data that the `store` knows. It's important to understand that in a peer-to-peer context, data can be shared freely between peers, but not read by everyone. So peer A may know some block of data about peer B, which they can freely send to all other peers. The other peers can only read it, if they have access to peer B's key.

``` js
swarm.on('connection', async connection => {
  ...
  store.replicate(connection) // This enables replication later on from this peer
  ...
})
```

## Step 5. Set up RPC and share access to local blocks of data

Another thing that we also want to handle is exchanging of read access to our own data. Without this key, the other peer cannot read data - but can still share it. There also needs to be a way of exchanging the actual chat messages. To do this, you'll use `protoxmux-rpc`.

First, set up the response messages. This is what will happen, when the peer calls these.

As you can seee, one is simply to return the access to our `userCore` data. In other cases you may want to build some form of authentication into this, but that depends on the usecase.

``` js
swarm.on('connection', async connection => {
  ...
  const rpc = new ProtomuxRPC(connection)
  rpc.respond('getKey', () => userCore.key) // Return our core's key, which grants read access
  rpc.respond('message', async data => {
    ...
  })
})
```

## Step 6. Get access to the other peer's blocks of data

If it's the first time this peer is seen, we want to ask them for their key, so we can read their shared data.

The `rpc.request('getKey')` calls the `rpc.respond('getKey', ...)` we saw above, but on the other peer's end. Now keys have been exchaged.

We use another hypercore, `peerCoreKeys` to store these keys in. Remember that this is also stored locally on your disk, so you'll not need to exchange keys when restarting.

With the shared key, we also add another hypercore instance. This allows us to actually read the data, which we'll cover in the next step.

``` js
swarm.on('connection', async connection => {
  ...
  const isCoreKeyKnown = !!await peerCoreKeys.get(remotePublicKey)
  if (!isCoreKeyKnown) {
    const coreKey = await rpc.request('getKey')
    createPeerCore(coreKey, remotePublicKey)
    await peerCoreKeys.put(connection.remotePublicKey, coreKey)
  }
})

function createPeerCore(coreKey, remotePublicKey) {
  const peerCore = store.get({ key: coreKey, valueEncoding: 'json' })

  trackLatestState(peerCore, remotePublicKey) // <-- We'll get back to this in the next step

  return peerCore
}
```
## Step 7. Continuously read updates to shared data

Now that keys have been shared, we can read their blocks of shared data.

With `await core.get(core.length - 1)` we read the latest block of data. Together with `core.on('append', ...)` we are able to always make sure to get the latest state.

The important part to understand is that even though the data we get is written by Peer A, we may have been sent it through other peers.

```js

function trackLatestState(core, remotePublicKey) {
  core.ready().then(reloadLatest)
  core.on('append', reloadLatest)

  async function reloadLatest() {
    if (core.length === 0) return
    const latestState = await core.get(core.length - 1)
    ...
  }
}
```

## Step 8. Read data when starting the app

The last part is actually the first part. When your app starts, you'll need to start listening to updates from the peers you already know. At the same time you should also listen to updates to your own `userCore`. This is important if the same peer would be connected from several clients at the same (meaning that several can write to the same hypercore), then they would still be able to share the state between them.


``` js
trackLatestState(userCore)
...
async function initAllPeerCores() {
  for await (const { key: remotePublicKey, value: coreKey } of peerCoreKeys.createReadStream()) {
    createPeerCore(coreKey, remotePublicKey)
  }
}
```

    $span.textContent = `<${nickname}>`
  ]
}
```

## Step 10. Running two different peers

In the previous version of the app you did not store anything on disk, so there were no issues when running multiple instances of the same app on the same computer. That was not a problem when we tested locally.

Now we use `const store = new Corestore(config.storage)` which stores data to disk. This can be a problem when running multiple instances because they would use and overwrite the same storage. You should use the `-s` flag to let Pear know what to set `config.storage` to.

Run one instance of the app:

```
$ pear dev -s /tmp/peer1
```

And in another terminal run another instance of the app:

```
$ pear dev -s /tmp/peer2
```

After a few messages have been exchanged:
![Some messages have been exchanged](/chat-app-7.png)

One user updates their nickname, and it is updated on the peers:
![Nickname has been updated](/chat-app-8.png)

## Learnings, main takeaways

- `hypercore` is an append-only log where each change is called a block
- `corestore` is a factory that can create `hypercores` and store them on disk
- Blocks of `hypercore` data can be shared amongst peers, but only read if they have been granted read access through `hypercore.key`
- You can overload a hyperswarm connection (a stream) for both replication of hypercores and messaging with `protomux-rpc`
- If you need a map or a tree in a `hypercore`, you can use `hyperbee`
